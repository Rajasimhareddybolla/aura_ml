## Phase 1: System Design and Development

### 1.1. Define Project Scope and Objectives
- Outline clear objectives for the project, specifying deployment areas and desired functionalities.
- Determine if the system will be city-wide or piloted in high-risk locations.
- Identify the primary threats to be detected (e.g., harassment, loitering).

### 1.2. Gather Requirements
- Collaborate with key stakeholders, including law enforcement, city officials, and women’s safety organizations, to collect comprehensive requirements.  
  _Sources: [2-4]_

### 1.3. Design System Architecture
- **Input Layer**: Define types and specifications of CCTV cameras (e.g., 720p at 15-30 FPS).
- **Processing Layer**: Choose the appropriate infrastructure:
  - **Hardware**: High-performance GPUs for deep learning tasks.
  - **Software**: Decide between cloud or edge computing for low-latency processing.
- **Output Layer**: Design user-friendly interfaces for real-time alerts and post-incident analysis.  
  _Sources: [5-11]_

### 1.4. Select and Train Machine Learning Models
- **Object Detection and Tracking**: Ultralytics YOLOv5/YOLOv8 with BoT-SORT for real-time person tracking.
- **Gender Classification**: Use MobileNetV2 for efficient gender classification.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Leverage the 2021 Georgescu et al. model using convolutional and recurrent layers or Transformers for threat identification.
- **Dataset**:
  - **Normal Behavior**: Footage of typical public activities.
  - **Anomalous Behavior**: Examples of harassment or threats, potentially collected from public datasets like XD-Violence.
